# MvM-Vaccinator-Fix
A plugin to fix uber duration for a vaccinator in MvM

This plugin is no longer needed, as Valve fixed it themselves on 7/7/2022. It used TF2Attributes to see what level of the purchased upgrade a player had and then hooking the uber event and overriding it with a longer version based on said upgrade. The code here is syntactically incorrect but I had not uploaded this online prior to the official fix.
